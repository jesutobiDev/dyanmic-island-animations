# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


<!-- My Process -->
# 1. Create the iphone interface: the height and width, to the border-radius, side buttons, background image, and dynamic island div
# 2. I want to make the background image change able 
# 3. Also, there would be a navigation at the bottom of the screen, it would have links for background change, animation choice etc..
# 4. Do a research on the different dynamic island animations and download different default iOS background images
